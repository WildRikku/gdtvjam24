Hi there dear jammers and friends of tactical games!  

For the GDTV Gamejam 2024 we had to create a game with the underlying theme "Last Stand". For some time we dreamt of making a **worms clone** and wanted to combine it with a funny robot setting.  

Our Game: Iron Warriors
-----------------------

### _Genre: turn-based tactical artillery game_

### Controls:

A,D or Arrow Keys to move  
hold W or UP Arrow to fly / boost into direction of head  
Space to control your weapon  
Mouse for choosing weapon  

If you find the targeting too tricky, here's a tip. You can abort weapon loading by clicking on the weapon again.

To play the game in the broser, switch to fullscreen view.

To run the game on Linux, add it to Steam and run it through Proton Experimental.

We hope you enjoy our game! The story mode will lead you through the game from start to finish while the PvP mode lets you chose a map. The story mode is PvP, too, we thought that's funnier than a lousy artificial intelligence enemy.

The game incorporates several things we always wanted to try out. First, it's a 2D game. WildRikku grew up with 2D DOS games and always wanted to make something from that era. We quickly agreed on a Worms-style game as we both loved the series.

The game has destructible terrain which was fun to play with. The code is by Ideefixze and linked below. We had to make almost no adjustments. We also used procedural animations for the legs of our spider bots.

The game contains full credits but we want to give special credit to those who share their code publicly and for free so we could use it.
